In my past life as a Delphi coder one of my favourite books was "Ready To Run Delphi 3.0 Algorithms" by Rod Stephens (1998). Great book, lots of code and a marvelous introduction to many useful algorithms and design patterns.

As I no longer enjoy the 'delights' of being a Delphi coder but still think it's a great book I've decided to go through the book, brush up on the algorithms and implement them in my current language of choice, C#, without using the built-in collections types.
